# 🎯 Real Interview Experience Scraping Approach

## 🚀 **New Approach: Scrape Real Interview Experiences**

Instead of generating generic questions, we now scrape **actual interview experiences** from people who have interviewed at similar companies/roles.

## 📋 **How It Works**

### **Step 1: Analyze Job Posting**
- Extract company name, position, level, and requirements
- Understand the role context and expectations

### **Step 2: Find Similar Roles**
- Identify the company and position level
- Look for similar job postings at the same company
- Extract company-specific information

### **Step 3: Scrape Real Interview Experiences**
- **LeetCode Discuss**: Company-specific interview questions
- **Glassdoor Interviews**: Real interview experiences and questions
- **Indeed Reviews**: Interview feedback and questions
- **Blind**: Anonymous interview experiences

### **Step 4: Extract Real Questions**
- Parse actual interview questions from experience posts
- Categorize as Technical/Behavioral
- Assess difficulty level
- Identify question patterns

### **Step 5: Generate Additional Questions**
- Use AI to generate questions based on patterns found
- Ensure consistency with real interview style
- Fill gaps where real questions are limited

## 🔍 **Question Extraction Process**

### **1. Pattern Recognition**
```python
question_patterns = [
    r'[Qq]uestion\s*\d*[:\-]?\s*([^.!?]*\?)',
    r'[Ww]hat\s+[^.!?]*\?',
    r'[Hh]ow\s+[^.!?]*\?',
    r'[Ww]hy\s+[^.!?]*\?',
    r'[Ee]xplain\s+[^.!?]*\?',
    r'[Dd]escribe\s+[^.!?]*\?'
]
```

### **2. Question Categorization**
- **Technical**: Code, algorithms, system design
- **Behavioral**: STAR method, teamwork, leadership
- **General**: Company culture, role understanding

### **3. Difficulty Assessment**
- **Easy**: Explain, describe, what, why
- **Medium**: How, implement, design, optimize
- **Hard**: Complex, advanced, algorithm, system design

## 🎯 **Output Structure**

```json
{
  "job_url": "https://linkedin.com/jobs/view/123456",
  "job_info": {
    "company": "Google",
    "position": "Software Engineer",
